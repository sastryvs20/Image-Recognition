# Image-Recognition
Image recognition is a task in computer vision that deals with the automatic identification and classification of objects in images. In this project we will employ a pretrained Residual Neural Network(Resnet101) to achieve this task. 

ResNet-101 is a convolutional neural nwtwork that was introduced in the paper  "Deep Residual Neural Learning for Image Recognition". It is a deep residual neural network that achieved state-of-art results on the imagenet classification challange. To access the paper of ResNet visit https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385.
